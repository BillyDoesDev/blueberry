# Welcome to the AISoC internal hackathon!

## Basics:

* Welcome team leader! You've been granted maintainer rights to this repository. Do not abuse this right.
* You can make your project public after completion of the hackathon if you want to.
* Feel free to add other team members as per your requirements.
* If external help is added to the repository apart from your team members, your team will be disqualified.

## Model submission:

* Submissions are only accepted from the team leader through GitHub releases.
* You can use the GitHub desktop app to upload your code and make releases (https://desktop.github.com/).
* Only upload your trained model to GitHub releases.
* Make sure to provide instructions on running your model in the release notes. 
* If you want to know more about how to upload your code / make releases then stay tuned for the next hackathon meeting where this will be explained in detail.

* NOTE: If the model exceeds the limits of GitHub, feel free to share your development environment with us when demonstrating your project.

## Licensing:

* If you are brave enough to license your code then do make sure to comply with the license of the code you copied from source.


## Good luck, have fun!
